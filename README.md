## Who I Am

I build production-grade systems designed to hold under scale, complexity, and real-world operational pressure. My work centers on transforming fragmented workflows into structured, defensible infrastructure that compounds over time.

As founder and engineer behind <b>IBIAS</b> and <b>TAXwise</b>, I design platforms that convert messy operational and financial data into clear strategic visibility. I operate where deep technical architecture meets business leverage — engineering not just for functionality, but for durability, trust, and sustained advantage.

## What I Build

🔹 Scalable full-stack systems from zero to production  
🔹 Decision engines grounded in structured analytics  
🔹 Financial and operational intelligence infrastructure  
🔹 Automation frameworks that reduce cognitive load  
🔹 Vertical SaaS platforms engineered for defensibility

## Engineering Principles

<div>

⚙️ **Architecture First**  
Systems are designed for longevity before features are layered on top.

📊 **Revenue Alignment**  
Software must connect to measurable business impact.

🧱 **Durability Over Speed**  
Shortcuts accumulate debt. Structure compounds value.

🧠 **Systems Thinking**  
Problems are rarely isolated. I design at the ecosystem level.

🔍 **Clarity Over Complexity**  
Elegant systems outperform impressive ones.

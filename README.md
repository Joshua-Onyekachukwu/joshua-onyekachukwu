## About Me

I design and ship production-grade software that drives measurable business outcomes.  
No prototypes disguised as products. No trend-chasing. Just systems that work.

I am the founder and engineer behind IBIAS, a growth intelligence platform built for the “missing middle” of e-commerce, and TAXwise, a tax intelligence system focused on financial clarity and compliance for modern businesses. Both products are engineered around one principle: transform fragmented operational data into structured, revenue-aligned decisions.

I operate at the intersection of engineering, product architecture, and business strategy. I build systems that scale, remain stable under pressure, and create real leverage.  
If it does not create durable value, it does not ship.
